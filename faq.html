                How does Graffiti work?
            </div>
            <div>
                Simple: all the posts on Graffiti are stored in a central database. The browser extension simply looks at what page you're viewing and fetches the posts for that page. When
                you leave a post, it's tagged with the current url so it will be fetched next time someone visits the same page.
            </div>

                How come it's only for Chrome?
            </div>
            <div>
                Chrome accounts for about 65% of all web browsing. Since Graffiti is still in deveopment, it makes sense to focus our efforts there. If we get a large number of users
                that proves the concept, we will look into expanding to other browsers.

                Is Graffiti safe to use?
            </div>
            <div>
                Graffiti accounts are anonymous - you can select any username you want (that isn't already taken) and there's no requirement to identify yourself. There are inherent risks with
                anonymous online interactions; you don't know who any of the other users are. This is why we require users to be at least 13 years old.

                <br>
                Graffiti does not record your browsing history or any personal information beyond the email address you provide when you create an account. We only use your email address for
                notifications about Graffiti; we do not share it with anyone else for any reason. We do not collect any other personal data of any kind. We strongly urge you to read our 
                <a class="normal-link" href="terms/index.html">terms</a> and <a class="normal-link" href="privacy/index.html">privacy</a> policies.
                <br>
                <br>
                Bear in mind any personal or identifying information you post on Graffiti is publicly viewable.

                What if I have a feature suggestion?
            </div>
            <div>
                You can leave feedback, including feature suggestions, right in the extension. Just open the extension by clicking on the
                icon in the Chrome toolbar and then click menu icon in the upper-right corner of the popup window to see the feedback option.
                You don't even need to be logged in.
