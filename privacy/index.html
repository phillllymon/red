    <h3>By downloading or using GRAFFITI, you agree to the following privacy policy:</h3>
    GRAFFITI has access to two sources of personal information: your email address, which you provide upon signup, and what websites you visit while the extension is enabled. We use 
    this information for no purpose other than the functionality of GRAFFITI. We may email you notifications if you are tagged in a post, recovery information if you forget your login information,
    or other updates about GRAFFITI. We will never sell or share your email address with third parties. In fact we have no personal information to tie to that email address that we could sell; we do not ask for a name or any other information when you sign up, except asking you to verify you are above the age of 13.
    We use your browsing information to display the comments for your current url. We do not record your browsing history, and the only record that may exist because of GRAFFITI that you visited any particular webpage will be a comment you post for that page.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you post personal information on GRAFFITI you do so at your own risk. Anything you post is publicly viewable by anyone with the GRAFFITI extension and you do not have the ability
    to edit or delete posts, even if you delete your account. Posts may be deleted by GRAFFITI; for example - we may delete posts associated with webpages that are no longer live or, to save storage space,
    delete old posts.
